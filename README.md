## June 13, 2024
‚úÖ I began designing the home page component by creating demo for the user interface. This creative process allowed me to visualize the user experience and think critically about design choices. I then reviewed and refined the component structure, adhering to established design principles and best practices. This step was both challenging and rewarding, as it required balancing aesthetics with functionality.

## June 14, 2024
‚úÖ Continuing my work on the home page design, I incorporated feedback to enhance the visual aesthetics. It was an iterative process, making small adjustments and seeing significant improvements.

#### ‚≠ê Thats how my 5-week internship training has gone. It was a great learning experience along with mentors and my partners who helped me with this. I faced a lot of problems during implementing the industry practices. My mentors guided me well in overcoming them. There are still many limitations of my project as i was learning new concepts through this. There are many things left to implement by my side. I was given certain task to complete after that and I am wroking on it.
